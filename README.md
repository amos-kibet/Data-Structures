## Below is a description of the challenge:
 * Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order,
 * find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number
 * (there is no guarantee that the 2 numbers exist) e.g.
 * Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
 * Output: [2,7] because 2 and 7 adds up to 9
 * (we are supposed to return an array of size 2 containing the numbers).
 * We can use a two-pointer approach as shown in the code above:
